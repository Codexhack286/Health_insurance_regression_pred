# Project Summary: Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## üìã Executive Summary

This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow for predicting medical insurance costs using machine learning. The analysis reveals key insights about factors affecting insurance pricing and builds a predictive model with approximately 75% accuracy (R¬≤ score).

## üéØ Key Findings

### Most Important Factors Affecting Insurance Costs:
1. **Smoking Status** - By far the strongest predictor (smokers pay significantly more)
2. **Age** - Positive correlation with insurance costs
3. **BMI** - Higher BMI associated with increased costs
4. **Number of Children** - Moderate impact on insurance pricing
5. **Region** - Some regional differences in pricing
6. **Sex** - Minimal impact on insurance costs

### Model Performance:
- **R¬≤ Score**: ~0.76 (explains 76% of variance in insurance costs)
- **Model Type**: Multiple Linear Regression
- **Data Processing**: Log transformation applied to handle skewed target variable

## üîç Technical Approach

### 1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
- **Dataset Size**: 1,338 insurance records
- **Features**: 7 variables (age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, region, charges)
- **Data Quality**: No missing values found
- **Target Variable**: Insurance charges (continuous, right-skewed)

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Log Transformation**: Applied to charges to normalize distribution
- **Dummy Variables**: Created for categorical features (sex, smoker, region)
- **Multicollinearity Check**: Used VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) analysis

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examined PDF of all variables
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified relationships between features
- **OLS Assumptions**: Validated model assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity)

### 4. Model Development
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression (sklearn)
- **Train-Test Split**: 80/20 ratio
- **Evaluation Metrics**: R¬≤ score, residual analysis
- **Model Validation**: Predictions vs actual scatter plots, residual distribution

## üìä Business Insights

### Cost Implications:
- **Smoking Premium**: Smokers can expect to pay 2-3x more than non-smokers
- **Age Factor**: Each additional year of age increases costs predictably
- **Health Metrics**: Higher BMI correlates with higher insurance costs
- **Family Size**: Additional dependents increase insurance costs

### Risk Assessment:
- The model successfully identifies high-risk individuals (smokers, older age, higher BMI)
- Regional differences suggest varying healthcare costs across geographic areas
- Model can be used for:
  - Premium pricing strategies
  - Risk assessment for new customers
  - Portfolio analysis for insurance companies

### Code Improvements to Try:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Create interaction terms (age √ó smoker, BMI √ó smoker)
2. **Model Comparison**: Compare with non-linear models
3. **Cross-Validation**: Implement k-fold cross-validation
4. **Regularization**: Try Ridge/Lasso regression to prevent overfitting

### Real-World Applications:
1. **Insurance Industry**: Premium calculation, risk assessment
2. **Healthcare**: Cost prediction, resource planning
3. **Personal Finance**: Budget planning for healthcare costs
